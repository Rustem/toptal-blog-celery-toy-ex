Basic Commands
--------------


Celery
^^^^^^

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd celery_uncovered
    celery -A celery_uncovered.taskapp worker -l info

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.


Email Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server `MailHog`_ with a web interface is available as docker container.

.. _mailhog: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check `cookiecutter-django Docker documentation`_ for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8025``


Test coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

    $ coverage run manage.py test
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html


Running tests with py.test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
